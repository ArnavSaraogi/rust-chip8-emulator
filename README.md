# Chip 8 Emulator in Rust
Arnav Saraogi (arnavs10) and Michele Autorino (ma152)

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to write a CHIP-8 emulator in Rust, and develop a simple CHIP-8 program that can be played with the emulator. We chose to work on this project because we were interested in lower level programming and wanted to learn more about emulation. 

## Technical Overview
### To-do:
1. Understand CHIP-8 architecture
2. Inplement memory and registers
3. Implement operation code fetching, decoding, and execution
5. Implement display for user
6. Implement input handling
7. Implement timers (for animation and sound generation)
8. Test emulator on existing CHIP-8 code
9. Implement error handling for buggy CHIP-8 code (bonus; if time)
10. Develop custom CHIP-8 code to play on the emulator

### Timeline
We are aiming to complete 1-5 by Checkpoint 1, and 6-10 by Checkpoint 2.

## Possible Challenges
We think there could be challenges in figuring out how to properly display the graphics specified by CHIP-8 programs and have working animations for the display. Error handling could also be challenging to implement due to the large range of potential errors we would need to account for. Finally, it could be a challenge to understand the low-level aspects of this project, since we don't have much experience with low-level programming.
